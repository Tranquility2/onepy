This was a testing project to try and get a single file python workable using http://nuitka.net/

For Linux I think a better alternative will be the "AppImage distributions of Python" 
https://github.com/niess/python-appimage
can be fetch from (for example)
https://github.com/niess/python-appimage/releases/download/python3.8/python3.8.6-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_i686.AppImage
